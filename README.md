# react-indexdb-app

This is a sample project demonstrating how to use IndexedDB in a React application for local storage. IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. It provides a way to persist data locally within the browser, which is useful for offline applications or for caching data to improve performance.
